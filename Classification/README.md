# CLASSIFICATION

This repository has two python programs
1. classification.py is based on conventional Machine Learning approach
2. classification_LSH_approach is based on LSH which is a probabilistic approach



You can download the dataset at : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/



## LSH 

It is probabilistic approach which comes handy when scaling up. LSH is quicker and more efficient
algorithm based on Minhashing technique and Locality sensitive hashing

indexing time is : O(n)
classification is: O(t) , where t = number of test cases




## Tfidf + classifier (CONVENTIONAL)

While conventional approach has scalability issues I have included 3 basic algorithms included in:
1. Naive Bayes
2. SVM
3. Logistic Regression
